BlockFun
========

I created this sample code to play with using a typedef to declare
a new block type, and then using that type. This is something that's
mentioned in docs, but there was no example of actual code for using
a typedef with blocks, so this was done to fill that hole. It's done
as a console app because that seemed fun to try at the time.

You can run the app in Xcode and see the output in the console, or
you can find the .app bundle in the derived products directory
Xcode uses on your system, and run it from the command line with:

./BlockFun.app
